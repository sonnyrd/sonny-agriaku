### 1. Before you build any model, you want first to explore the raw data. What kind of analyses you would do? What kind of data pre-processing you would do? Please explain your logic and show the result of your preparatory analyses. [Point 7]

### 2.Can you build a Machine Learning model (not Artificial Neural Network) to categorize the alcohol molecule given readings from the electronic nose? (Please consider the MIP: NP ratio as one of the features as well) Please justify your choice of algorithm and walk us through your logic as you develop the model. What is the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model? [Point 10]

### 3.Can you build an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to categorize the alcohol molecule given readings from the electronic nose? (Please consider the MIP:NP ratio as one of the features as well) Please justify your choice of algorithm and walk us through your logic as you develop the model. What is the accuracy, precision, and recall of the model? [Point 10]

### 4.You were asked to convert your model to API, so that the researchers can perform the alcohol identification in real-time. How would you do this (you donâ€™t have to make the actual API)? [Point 8]
